java-pitfalls
=============

A collection of Java code examples containing typical (sometimes subtle) programming errors.

Instructions
============

* Each class in folder ```src``` contains at least one programming error
* For the best learning experience view the code directly on [github.com](https://github.com/bkimminich/java-pitfalls/tree/master/src/de/kimminich/pitfalls) or use a text editor as some IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) will complain about some of the bugs out-of-the-box
* Only look at a corresponding test class in folder ```test``` if you cannot find the bug(s) otherwise
* If the test doesn't help (or there is none for that class) you might want to run [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) on that particular file

Enjoy!
