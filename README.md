Java Pitfalls
=============

A collection of Java code examples containing typical (sometimes subtle) programming errors.

Instructions
============

* Each class in package ```de.kimminich.pitfalls``` of folder ```src``` contains at least one programming error
* For the best learning experience view the code directly on [github.com](https://github.com/bkimminich/java-pitfalls/tree/master/src/de/kimminich/pitfalls) or use a text editor as some IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) will complain about some of the bugs out-of-the-box
* Only check a corresponding ```Hint``` class in folder ```src-hints``` if you cannot find the bug(s) otherwise
* If the test doesn't help (or there is none for that class) you might want to run [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) on that particular file
* A possible fix for each pitfall can be found in the corresponding ```Fixed``` classes in folder ```src-fixed```

Enjoy!
